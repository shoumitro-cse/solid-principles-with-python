## SOLID Principles with Python?

Answer:
SOLID principles are a series of good practices that will make you write better quality software. 
This looks like a long article but actually it is not. Just the codes takes a little bit more space :)

```
SOLID stands for:

S: Single responsibility principle
O: Open/Closed principle
L: Liskov’s substitution principle
I: Interface segregation principle
D: Dependency inversion principle

```

## Single Responsibility Principle(SRP):

For Turkish readers, I will summarize this principle with only one sentence: “Nerede çokluk orada ….”:)

A software component must have only one responsibility. It must have only one reason to change. If you need to modify the class 
for different reasons, this means something( an abstraction) is missing and you need to fix this. If a class has lots of 
responsibilities this class is often called a “God class” because they know too much or do too much, more than they should do. 
This type of class is very hard to maintain and the smaller the class, the better.

What we strive to achieve here is that classes are designed in such a way that most of their properties and their attributes are 
used by their methods, most of the time. When this happens, we know they are related concepts, and therefore it makes sense to 
group them under the same abstraction.

For example, when you look at the methods of the class and see there are some unrelated functions (with each other), you can tell 
that this class has to be broken down.

Single Responsibility Principle Example
Take a loot at the SystemMonitor class. You can see there are three different reasons to make a change in this class.
Maybe we decide to change how we load the activities, parse the events, or how we send the events (maybe we’ve decided to use 
Redis Streams instead of Kafka).

The picture on the right is better and reuseable. If we need to change something in how we load the data, we will only modify one 
class and the other classes will know nothing if we do not break the contract. Additionally, we can create an interface for let’s 
say loading events with a load function and we can use that interface to create classes with different loading codes 
(maybe loading from different sources). And we can use these classes as a plug-and-play.

The classes could have more than one method as long as they serve the same purpose.

Try with one big monolithic class first and then try to separate it. This will help to get a clearer picture of the new abstraction 
that you need to create.

## Open-Closed Principle

A class must be open to extension but closed to modification. When we want to add new things to our model, we only want to add new things and not change anything existing that is closed to modification. This principle is very easy to understand with a concrete example. Let’s start with a bad example:

```
class Employee:
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, salary: str):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
    
    
class Tester(Employee):
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, salary: str):
        super().__init__(name, salary)
    
    def test(self):
        print("{} is testing".format(self.name))

class Developer(Employee):
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, salary: str):
        super().__init__(name, salary)
    
    def develop(self):
        print("{} is developing".format(self.name))


class Company:
    
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    
    def work(self, employee):
        if isinstance(employee, Developer):
            employee.develop()
        elif isinstance(employee, Tester):
            employee.test()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown employee")  
```


Why this is a bad example? Think about it for a second. How can you add an Analyst to this "Company"? Well, you can create a new class as a subclass of the Employee and then add one more if to Company’s work function. Well yes, it works but did you really like the solution? What will you do when new types of Employees come? This if-elif chain eventually will become hell and very hard to maintain. Now let’s see how we can fix this:


```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Employee(ABC):

    def __init__(self, name: str, salary: str):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    @abstractmethod
    def work(self):
        pass


class Tester(Employee):

    def __init__(self, name: str, salary: str):
        super().__init__(name, salary)

    def test(self):
        print("{} is testing".format(self.name))

    def work(self):
        self.test()

class Developer(Employee):

    def __init__(self, name: str, salary: str):
        super().__init__(name, salary)

    def develop(self):
        print("{} is developing".format(self.name))

    def work(self):
        self.develop()

class Company:

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

    def work(self, employee: Employee):
        employee.work()



carbon = Company("Carbon")
developer = Developer("Nusret", "1000000")
tester = Tester("Someone", "1000000")
carbon.work(developer) # Will print Nusret is developing
carbon.work(tester) # Will print Someone is testing
```

What changed? Now Employee is an abstract class and it has an abstract method called work. All subclasses of this class have to implement a work function. Developer calls its develop method and Tester calls its test method. In the company, all we had to do is calling the work() method of the given employee. If I need to add a new Employee like an Analyst, all I need to do is implement the work() method and done!


## Liskov’s Substitution Principle

The formal definition is:
if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced by objects of type S, without breaking the program.


I will begin with a rule special to Python and then show the general example. Why there is a special rule for Python? 
Because no one can stop you from doing this:

```
class SuperClass:
	def check(name: str)-> str:
		return name

class SubClass(SuperClass):
	def check(name: dict) -> dict:
		return name
		
class AnotherSubclass(SuperClass):
	def check(name: str, surname: str) -> tuple:
		return name, surname
```

The program will work buuut… it will eventually crash somewhere. So, this is the special rule for Python because it allows doing this… How to protect yourself from these types of situations? The answer is holy python tool mypy and pylint. Both tools help you to find those mistakes and more!

The second rule comes from the design by contract principle:
A subclass can never make preconditions stricter than they are defined in the parent class
A subclass can never make postconditions weaker than they are defined in the parent class

Let’s say your base class checks a dictionary and raises an Exception if the dictionary doesn’t contain the key “session_id”. A subclass of this class cannot say “The dictionary has to contain a key “class_id” too”. And if your base class checks if the returned value is a dictionary with a key “result”, you can’t lift this restriction in the subclass.

Now let’s give a more general example independent from 🐍 . Let’s say we have a class structure like this:

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Member(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    @abstractmethod
    def save_database(self):
        pass


class Teacher(Member):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, teacher_id: str):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.teacher_id = teacher_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving teacher data to database")


class Student(Member):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int , student_id: str):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.student_id = student_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving student data to database")
        
# We can successfully run this code with this structure:
from typing import List
members: List[Member] = []
members.apped(Student('nusret',23,"12345"))
members.apped(Teacher('Teacher_nusret',23,"12345"))
for member in members:
	member.save_database()
```
	
Now let’s modify the code and add one more abstract method pay(). For the sake of easiness, 
I will assume students cannot pay because it is free for them.


```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Member(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    @abstractmethod
    def save_database(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self):
        pass


class Teacher(Member):
    def __init__(self, name, age, teacher_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.teacher_id = teacher_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving teacher data to database")

    def pay(self):
        print("Paying")


class Manager(Member):
    def __init__(self, name, age, manager_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.manager_id = manager_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving manager data to database")

    def pay(self):
        print("Paying")


class Student(Member):
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.student_id = student_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving student data to database")

    def pay(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("It is free for students!")
        
        
from typing import List
members: List[Member] = []
members.apped(Student('nusret',23,"12345"))
members.apped(Teacher('Teacher_nusret',23,"12345"))
for member in members:
	member.pay()
```


Now this example cannot work! Both classes are a subclass of the Member class but the Student class will throw exceptions or not work as expected. This is against the rule. If a Member has to pay, we can clearly say that a Studentcannot be a Member. To solve this problem, we can remove the pay() method from Member and create a new abstract class Payer. Very sorry for the naming but I couldn’t come up with a better name... Now our structure should be like this:


```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Payer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self):
        pass

class Member(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    @abstractmethod
    def save_database(self):
        pass


class Teacher(Member, Payer):
    def __init__(self, name, age, teacher_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.teacher_id = teacher_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving teacher data to database")

    def pay(self):
        print("Paying")


class Manager(Member, Payer):
    def __init__(self, name, age, manager_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.manager_id = manager_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving manager data to database")

    def pay(self):
        print("Paying")


class Student(Member):
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.student_id = student_id

    def save_database(self):
        print("Saving student data to database")


payers: List[Payer] = [Teacher("John", 30, "123"), Manager("Mary", 25, "456")]
for payer in payers:
    payer.pay()
```

Now, this will work and it is appropriate for the principle!

## Interface Segregation Principle:

Instead of one fat interface, create interfaces as small as possible based on a group of methods each one serving one submodule. 
For example, this is a bad example:

```
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class EventParser(metaclass=ABCMeta):
	
	@abstractmethod
	def from_xml(xml_data: str):
		"Parse an event from XML"
	
	@abstractmethod
	def from_json(json_data: str):
		"Parse an event from JSON"
```

Why this is bad? Because what if a class that implements this interface doesn’t need to use the from_json method? Here we force a class to implement an interface they don’t want to use. The true approach is to create 2 different interfaces for those functions.


```
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod
class XMLEventParser(metaclass=ABCMeta):
	
	@abstractmethod
	def from_xml(xml_data: str):
		"Parse an event from XML"
	
class JSONEventParser(metaclass=ABCMeta):
	
	@abstractmethod
	def from_json(json_data: str):
		"Parse an event from JSON"


class RestClient(JSONEventParser):
	...

class SoapClient(XMLEventParser):
	...

```


## Dependency Inversion principle:

Let’s say you need to charge your phone. You would connect the adapter to the socket and it is done. You wouldn’t think about what is behind the wall and details of how you get the electricity (I mean if you are not an electrical engineer or something like that). This should be the case with your classes too. Your high-level classes (such as ActivityStreamer) should depend upon abstractions/interfaces, not concrete classes. Let’s give an example of bad practice:

```
class Syslog:

    def write(self, msg):
        with open('path', 'a') as f:
            f.write(msg)


class EventStreamer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.event_stream = Syslog()

    def send_event(self, event):
        self.event_stream.write(event)  
```

     
What are the problems with that code?

1. What if the name of the write() method changes? This class could be from a library or could be a class 
   from the other team. Now you had to change your code when they change too because you depend on a concrete 
   class in your high-level class.

2 If we want to change the data destination for a different one or add new ones at runtime, 
  we are also in trouble because we will find ourselves constantly modifying the stream() method 
  to adapt it to these requirements. How could we design our classes so that we could get rid of those problems?


```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class EventSender(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send(self, event):
        pass


class Syslog(EventSender):

    def write(self, msg):
        with open('path', 'a') as f:
            f.write(msg)

    def send(self, event):
        self.write(event)


class Monitorlog(EventSender):

    def write(self, msg):
        with open('path', 'a') as f:
            f.write(msg)

    def send(self, event):
        self.write(event)


class EventStreamer:
    def __init__(self, sender: EventSender):
        self.event_stream = sender

    def send_event(self, event):
        self.event_stream.send(event)
        
obj_1 = EventStreamer(Syslog())
obj_1.send_event("sys log msg")

obj_2 = EventStreamer(Monitorlog())
obj_2.send_event("monitor log msg")
```


Here we are depending on the abstraction using EventSender. Whatever subclass we get, we can just call send() method of this and we know that our event will be sent to the true place. And If we wanted to change the destination, we can just create a different subclass and give it in the __init__() method of EventStreamer.

I think that is all I can say! Thanks for reading!
